Perqara Assessment - E-Commerce Dataset Analysis

The objective of this notebook is to completing the assessment given by Perqara and to propose an analytical view of e-commerce relationship within the data. 
For this first I went trough an exploratory data analysis using graphical tools to create self explanatory plots for better understanding what is behind the data online purchasing.

In this notebook I started inspecting and cleaning the data, then I performed an EDA and RFM analysis to segment the customers and answer a series of business questions, which will be:
- What is the number of orders per status?
- What is the number of orders per state?
- What has been the number of orders and revenue over time?
- What is the distribution of the payment value?
- What type of payment is most commonly used?
- Top categories by payment value and review rating
- What type of customers do we have?
- Who are our best customers?

After that, I created machine learning model to make a churn probability prediction using various models based on RFM analysis.

I'm still a beginner, so any suggestions or comments are very welcomed!
